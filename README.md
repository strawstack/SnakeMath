# SnakeMath

![](./logo.png)

This `readme` covers everything you need to know to understand and start using SnakeMath. The goal of SnakeMath aligns with the simple goals all snakes share: `motivate computer science`, and `promote snake culture`.

`SnakeMath` uses postfix operator syntax, a stack, and a grid to render 5x5 characters. It's inspired by [the adventures of a scientist and his grandson](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rattlestar_Ricklactica). For example, the following expression renders the letter `S`:

    S.u.(u.S).u.(Yo.Yu.Yccc).u.(Yo.Yu.Yc).Yo.Y@

# Understanding SnakeMath

To understand SnakeMath you have to understand snakes, or, more specifically, understand *my* understanding of snakes. The following three principles provide a good amount of insight to snake behavior and, by extension, SnakeMath:

1. Snakes like to `slither` along paths.
2. Snakes like to `share` their paths with other snakes.
3. Snakes prefer to slither on `meaningful` paths.

# Why SnakeMath?

Snakes like to `slither`, and snakes like to `share`, so, naturally, snakes have developed a syntax with which they can share expressions that describe the paths they slither along. Snakes like to slither on `meaningful` paths, and paths are all-the-more meaningful if a good `slither-path` can be shared amongst `snake-friends`.

# How SnakeMath Works

**Symbols**: Snake math uses only eleven symbols: `o`, `c`, `u`, `s`, `S`, `3`, `Y`, `.`, `@`, `(`, and `)`.

**The Nest**: The symbols above are combined in specific ways to create SnakeMath `expressions` which `draw` characters to a 5x5 grid (called `the nest`). The state of the 5x5 grid is rendered to form the output of the given SnakeMath expression. Each element of `the nest` is initialized to `.` at the start of an expression.

**The Stack**: SnakeMath expressions are parsed from `left to right` (a direction that snakes like to move). During parsing, integers are pushed to a `stack` (a data-structure that snakes like almost as much as linked-lists do to its similarity to their own bodies). When `operators` are encountered, integers from the stack are sometimes used to preform a calculation, and the result is pushed to the stack. The stack starts out empty at the beginning of an expression.

# Evaluating a SnakeMath Expression

Snakes begin slithering in the lower-left cell of their nest and are facing right. SnakeMath expressions direct a snake to slither around their nest. Every cell in the nest that is touched gets tagged with `s`. In the diagram below, I use `>` to represent a snake that is facing to the right:

    .....
    .....
    .....
    .....
    >....

Let's evaluating the following SnakeMath expression:

    S.u.(u.S).u.(Yo.Yu.Yccc).u.(Yo.Yu.Yc).Yo.Y@

This expression causes the snake to travel around its nest. The resulting path looks like this:

    ssss>
    s....
    sssss
    ....s
    sssss

The expression has finished evaluating and the snakes path has the shape of a letter `S`. As we will see below, the operator `@` causes the grid to be saved as one character of output. If the expression were longer, more characters could be saved and output by the expression.

## Integers

- *`o`, `c`, `u`, `s`, `S`, `3`*: These symbols are called `snake shapes` and they can be used to represent the digits of a `base six` integer. Each symbol has a value from 0 to 5. `o is zero` and `3 is five`. `c`, `u`, `s`, `S` have values 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. Think of `snake shapes` as hex numbers only instead of using `0 to F` to represent `0 to 15`, we use `o to 3` to represent `0 to 5`. Numbers are written so that the left-most digit is the most significant digit. When an integer is parsed during evaluation of a SnakeMath expression, the integer is immediately pushed to the stack.

## Delimiter Symbol

- `.`: This symbol is used as the separator between integers and operators.

## Operator Indicator

- `Y`: This symbol means interpret the next set of symbols as a string of operators. See below for a list of operators.

## Operators

In this section, let `{1}` be the value on the top of the stack, and let `{2}` be the value under {1}.

- `o`: Pop {1}, and move forward by value of {1}.

- `c`: Turn clockwise.

- `u`: Copy {1} and push copy to stack.

- `s`: Pop and `multiply` {1} and {2} then push result.

- `S`: Pop and `subtract` {1} and {2} then push result.

- `3`: Pop and `add` {1} and {2} then push result.

- `@`: Save the current state of the 5x5 grid, and clear the grid.

## Brackets

- `(` and `)`: When an expression is enclosed in brackets. Pop {1} and repeat the enclosed expression a number of times equal to {1} before moving on to the rest of the expression.

# SnakeMath Expressions

This expression causes five numbers to be pushed to the stack.

    cu.su.S3.3.o.co
    resulting stack: 8, 20, 29, 5, 0

**examples.py**: Run this file with `python examples.py`. This file will run some demo expressions, and print the output to the console.

**SnakeMath.py**: This file is the python implementation of SnakeMath.

# Dev Notes

- [ ] Implement nested bracket.
    - [ ] If bracket encountered inside bracket then push new bracket index to a stack
